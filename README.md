This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## NOTES BY AUTHOR

- Overall was a fun and challenging experience, but did not have enough time. You can tell in what was incomplete and some sloppiness in my code. The last hour was literally me stressing out hahaha. 
- I was a bit ambitious to incorporate Redux in the project and thus cut my time down significantly. 
- Therefore I did not have the chance to do much of the css and any of the unit testing.
- Also did not have enough time to store the results and re-fetch them from a database.
- I haven't touched css (have been using scss) in a while, therefore it can be a bit rusty. 
- Wanted to use scss, but would need to eject entire project and update webpack. (Time consuming)
- I assumed that when a user clicks, they can no longer vote if the poll is 'Single Type'
- After user clicks in a 'Single' type poll, they cannot vote again. (Did not include css to indicate to user that they cannot click again).

- To run the project, run `npm install` to load all the dependencies, and then run `npm start` to run project.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
